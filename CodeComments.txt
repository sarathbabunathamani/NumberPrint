Code Walkthrough Comments
==========================
1.Planning to create a util class to convert number to roman letter or words as per the requirement.
2.Planning to write a unit test case using Junit.So that i can test it with both positive and negCreatiative scenarios.
3.It will also make sure your code is exactly matching the requirement.
4.Creating a Java project and utility class called NumberPrintUtility.java under util package.
5.It has two core methods.One is to convert number to ROMAN and other one is converting number to WORDS.
6.It contains another method to call these core methods depends upon the outputformat.
7.In this method we are checking the number is in the range between 1 to 3999 as per the requirement.
8.If the inputnumber is not in that range ,then utility will not proceed further.it will exit at that place.

Convering the number in to words
================================

method name : convertNumberToWords

It takes the int as input parameter.so there is no need to check if input has any special character exists or not.
Then we are checking the length to make sure how many digits in that number.This will tell me whether its thousands or hundereds or tens or single digit.
if the number has length as 4,then i will consider that number is in thousands.so we can define the first number as thousands.
After that 3rd digit will be considered as hundereds.Normally we use "and" in conjuction with hundreds when we read the number in words.
for example,2657 - Two thousand Six hundred "and" fifty seven.This is the logic behind this method.



Converting Number to ROMAN letters
===================================

method:convertNumberToRoman

In this method we are taking the input number and checking the range .For example,if its 1234,then it will be greater than 1000.
In that case we will convert it as M and substract 1000 from the input.so that 234 will consider as the input for next flow.
Like wise it will keep on iterate untill it reaches the single digit.This is the logic behind this method
